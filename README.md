# DNCE – Truthfully

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I was always the one dodging phone calls
From every girl that I met in my bed
But then you came along like a brick wall
You knocked me out out of my head
Had me treating my Monday's like Friday's
Had me flying so high with no smoke
Almost dreaming of you always with me
Damnit I feel feel like a joke
Speaking truthfully I'm not sure why we keep
Fighting
You just go blame the bad
Timing
Admit to me
Speaking truthfully
I love you more than u love me
Getting more of your time was a challenge
Had me begging u like a school boy
Starting treating me like a bad habit
So now I'm left, left with no choice
Now I know there's no use trying
To get me and you on the same page
When you say that you love me you're lying

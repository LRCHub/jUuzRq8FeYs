I seek truth no use it's within me
How deep would I go to find what I know about me
You don't know me like God does, like I do
I have trained myself to know how to sing
I trust myself, believe in everything
And I know I can keep up with my mind
Because I have a practice that's aligned
With my belief system, I diss them, I can tell truth from a lie
And I don't miss them oh
I would kiss them goodbye

I awake to my truth
I was dreaming about you
I envision a world where we live in our heart too
We've come this far
Why turn back now
This world is ours
If you don't believe you won't know how

Open up to what's true inside you
Embrace gifts as they will emerge through
All that is will change and continue
Open your heart attune to your virtue
Love yourself to full capacity
Allow yourself to live in reality
I am breathing in all that is real
I acknowledge how I feel

Truthfully, truthfully, truthfully, truthfully
Truthfully, truthfully, oh

Seek the truth it ain't hard to find
Just let go leave the past behind
I can see it, I can be it; the change I wish to see in the world
I believe that I can be the change I want to see in my world

I awake to my truth
I was dreaming about you
I envision a world where we live in our heart too
We've come this far
This world is ours
If you don't believe you won't know how
Oh you won't know how

Truthfully, truthfully, truthfully,
Truthfully, truthfully, truthfully
